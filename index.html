    <h1 class="thehead"><span> >Index.</span></h1>
    <p>You might be wondering why i made this page at first. An introduction, shall we?</p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Justyn Anthonyo. For others, you may know me more as Bunta or Minarie. I am an Informatics Engineering student at Institute of Business and Technology Pelita Indonesia.</p>
    <p>That was.. short(?) but anyways, I know, those apes.. has been acting up, no?, I heard ya' can't boot up Steam and such right now. But fret not, Papa Jus is here to fix that issue easily.</p>  
    <h2 class="thehead"><span> >The Path.</span></h2>
    <p>First, get yourself the <a href="https://simplednscrypt.org">Simple DNSCrypt</a> client.</p>
    <p>Get the x64 .msi, and install it.</p>
    <p>Just press next a buncha' times until it's done installing.</p>
    <p>Launch the app, you should be greeted with this screen:</p>
    <img src="assets/help1.png" class="rounded" alt="DNSCrypt menu">
    <p>Next, turn on the DNSCrypt Service, click on your currently connected network card and tick Using IPv6 Server, click on apply settings</p>
    <p class="importante">DO NOT CLICK ON REMOVE SERVICE.</p>
    <p>After that, hop over to the Resolvers menu, you should now see this:</p>
    <img src="assets/help2.png" class="rounded" alt="DNSCrypt Resolver menu">
    <p>Select both ipv4 and ipv6 CLoudflare DNS Resolvers, make sure they are <strong>green</strong> after you select it and then apply settings. It should look like this:</p>
    <img src="assets/help3.png" class="rounded" alt="DNSCrypt Resolver menu after modifications">
    <p>After all of that, you are done.... basically. However, you would need to boot up the app everytime to start the DoH proxy every restart / after boot.</p>
    <p>We can fix that however, follow these steps.</p>
    <p>Click on the Windows start menu, and find the DNSCrypt shortcut.</p>
    <p>Right click on the shortcut, click on More and Open File Location.</p>
    <img src="assets/autoboothelp.png" class="rounded" alt="Start menu shortcut">
    <p>After that, copy the shortcut inside the folder</p>
    <img src="assets/autoboothelp2.png" class="rounded" alt="Shortcut">
    <p>Press the Windows Key + R to open the run menu</p>
    <p>type/copy -> shell:startup in the Run menu</p>
    <img src="assets/autoboothelp3.png" class="rounded" alt="Shortcut">
    <p>A folder should now open</p>
    <p>Paste your DNSCrypt shortcut inside the Startup folder</p>
    <img src="assets/autoboothelp4.png" class="rounded" alt="Shortcut">
    <p>DNSCrypt now should autostart every boot.</p>
    <p>Aaaand... that is it. You now can open Steam, Reddit and many more.</p>
